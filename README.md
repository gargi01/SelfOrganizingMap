# SelfOrganizingMap

### Objective: Fraud Detection using unsupervised Deep Learning technique: Self Organizing Map (SOM)
- To detect fraudulent customers.
- We have a data of customers who applied for credit cards. The target Variable "Class" is binary variable wherein 0 means their application was not approved, and 1 means it was approved.
- We aim to detect fraudulent customers, who are similar to customers with Class=0 with respect to the underlying attributes. But for these customers, their credit card application was approved and hence they have Class=1.
